title: Shoes, a Tiny Toolkit Of Ruby
---

<span style="font-weight: normal; ">Shoes is a very informal graphics and windowing toolkit. It's for making regular old apps that run on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. It's a blend of my favorite things from the Web, some Ruby style, and a sprinkling of cross-platform widgets. (More in the <a class="source" href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes/browser/trunk/README" target="_blank">README</a>, or at the new<a class="ext-link" href="http://shoooes.net/" target="_blank"><span class="icon">shoooes.net</span></a>!)</span>
click <a href="http://the-shoebox.org/" target="_blank">here</a> , you can find a lot of application demo . 

i like the <a href="http://the-shoebox.org/apps/36" target="_blank">minesweeper</a> , more interesting is that it only 270 lines of code .
