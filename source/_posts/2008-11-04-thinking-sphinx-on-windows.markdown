title: Thinking Sphinx on Windows
---

<img class="excerpt_image" title="Sphinx" src="http://www.expressionlab.com/assets/2008/10/29/sphinx.gif" alt="Sphinx" /> In one of my Ruby on Rails projects, I needed a full-text search engine to integrate. And after some research, I decided that <a href="http://ts.freelancing-gods.com/" target="_blank">Thinking Sphinx</a> is the way to go. It seemed simple, fast and well documented. Unfortunately, I had some issues when tried to get it running on Windows.

The first step is installing Sphinx itself. While this looks simple, it took me five hours to move to the next step!
